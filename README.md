### **ðŸš€ Day 2 of my 15-day SQL revision journey with MySQL! ðŸŽ‰ Even with my experience in SQL, I'm excited to revisit the basics and showcase my skills to potential recruiters. Today, I set up my environment and manipulating data using select query to select data from tables which was created  from sql-learning-day 1. This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for more SQL practice and insights over the 15 days!** ###

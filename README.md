# SQL-Revision
### **ðŸš€ Day 2 of my 15-day SQL revision journey with MySQL! ðŸŽ‰ Even with my experience in SQL, I'm excited to revisit the basics and showcase my skills to potential recruiters. Today, I set up my environment and manipulating data using select query to select data from tables which was created  from sql-learning-day 1. This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for more SQL practice and insights over the 15 days!** ###

### The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database, which is used to manipulating data.
## Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from.

The table_name represents the name of the table you want to select data from.
